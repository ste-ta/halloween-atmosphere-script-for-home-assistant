```

## üîß Customization

### Adjusting Effect Speed

Find the delay values in each effect and modify:

```yaml
# Faster (reduce delays)
- delay:
    seconds: "{{ range(2, 4) | random }}"  # Instead of range(4, 7)

# Slower (increase delays)
- delay:
    seconds: "{{ range(6, 10) | random }}"  # Instead of range(4, 7)
```

### Adding Custom Colors

Locate the `colors:` section in any effect and add your RGB values:

```yaml
colors:
  - [255, 0, 0]      # Red
  - [0, 255, 0]      # Green
  - [0, 0, 255]      # Blue
  - [255, 255, 0]    # Your custom color
```

### Adjusting Brightness Range

Modify the `brightness_levels:` array:

```yaml
brightness_levels:
  - 255  # Maximum
  - 200
  - 150
  - 100  # Minimum
```

### Creating a New Effect

Copy an existing effect block and modify:

```yaml
# Add to the choose: section
- conditions:
    - condition: template
      value_template: "{{ effekt == 'your_effect_name' }}"
  sequence:
    # Your custom effect logic here
```

Don't forget to add your effect name to the selector options at the top!

## üìä Performance Notes

- **Network Traffic**: Optimized for Zigbee networks with proper delays
- **Recommended Lights Per Call**: Up to 10 lights (more may cause delays on older hubs)
- **Effect Cycle Time**: 3-14 seconds depending on effect and randomization
